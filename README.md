# README #

This project is a part of X-Environment. This Java Tango server uses [libpniio-jni](http://bitbucket.org/hzgwpn/libpniio-jni) to write data into a NeXus file.

## Requirements ##

Due to libpniio-jni limitation this server can be run only on Debian wheezy. All dependencies of the cpp part of jni must be installed.


Have fun!
